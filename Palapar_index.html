<h1>-PALAPAR, Earl Joseph</h1>

<p>-My favorite CMSC subject is CMSC 100 because Ma'am Monina Carandang is the prof.</p>

<p>-My favorite food is hotdog because it is long and delicious.</p>

<p>-A little bit about myself is that I am currently a third year CMSC student studying in UPLB. I stay at a boarding house here in UPLB near the campus but my home address is located at Manila. I am not part of any student group in the university, be it an organization or a fraternity. I am also a person who loves to travel anywhere especially to very far places. I am currently delayed in my studies here in the university, my expected graduate time is at least 2 years from now. Another thing about me is I do not know exactly what I am coding right now because I have forgotten whatever little background I may have in HTML and CSS because I have taken the subject CMSC 2 two years ago.</p>

<p>-My expectations for the subject and the teacher is that I will be able to pass this subject and my teacher will pass me since I don't want to take this subject two times :( hahah</p>
